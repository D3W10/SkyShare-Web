## About

SkyShare is both a desktop and a web application that allows you to share files between devices. The objective of the web app is to make the SkyShare services available to any device that has a web browser. Not all features present in the desktop app are available in the web app!

> üñ•Ô∏è&emsp;SkyShare [Desktop App](https://github.com/D3W10/SkyShare)
>
> üîå&emsp;SkyShare [API](https://github.com/D3W10/SkyShare-API)
>
> üåê&emsp;SkyShare [Web App](https://github.com/D3W10/SkyShare-Web)
