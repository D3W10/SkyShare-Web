## About

SkyShare is both a desktop and a web application that allows you to share files between devices. The objective of the web app is to make the SkyShare services available to any device that has a web browser. Not all features present in the desktop app are available in the web app!

This project consists in four different subprojects:
> 🖥️&emsp;SkyShare [Desktop App](https://github.com/D3W10/SkyShare)
>
> 🔌&emsp;SkyShare [API](https://github.com/D3W10/SkyShare-API)
>
> 🌐&emsp;SkyShare [Web App](https://github.com/D3W10/SkyShare-Web)
